Lemma lem_dec `{Countable A} (X Y Z : gset A) :
    X ⊆ Y ∪ Z
      -> exists Y' Z', Y' ⊆ Y /\ Z' ⊆ Z /\ (Y' ∪ Z' ≡ X)%stdpp.
Proof.
  induction X using set_ind_L; intros sub.
  - exists ∅, ∅. set_solver.
  - assert (sub0 : X ⊆ Y ∪ Z) by set_solver.
    destruct (IHX sub0) as (Y0 & Z0 & sub1 & sub2 & eq).
    assert (mem_dec : x ∈ Y \/ x ∈ Z). set_solver.
    destruct mem_dec.
    + exists ({[x]} ∪ Y0), Z0. set_solver.
    + exists Y0, ({[x]} ∪ Z0). set_solver.

Lemma exists_forall_in {B} (ps : list B) (P : B -> Prop) (Q : B -> Prop)
  (h : forall p, p ∈ ps -> P p \/ Q p) : Exists P ps \/ Forall Q ps.
Proof.
  induction ps as [|p ?]. eauto.
  destruct IHps; destruct (h p); eauto; set_solver.
